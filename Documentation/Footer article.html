### tl;dr

2.1.2 is now 2.2.0: four new example templates, added media component, new typographic scale, fixed that box-shadow mixin bug, fixed z-index issues, and [more](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues?milestone=15&page=1&state=closed).

### Highlights

- **Added four new example templates** to the docs, including a narrow marketing page, sign in form, sticky footer, and a fancy carousel (created for an upcoming .net magazine article).
- **Added the media component**, to create larger common components like comments, Tweets, etc.
- **New variable-driven typographic scale** based on `@baseFontSize` and `@baseLineHeight`.
- Revamped mini, small, and large padding via new variables for inputs and buttons so everything is the same size.
- Reverted 2.1.1's `.box-shadow();` mixin change that caused compiler errors.
- Improved dropdown submenus to support dropups and left-aligned submenus.
- Fixed z-index issues with tooltips and popovers in modals.
- Hero unit now sets basic type styles for the entire component, rather than on `.hero-unit p { ... }`.
- Updated JavaScript plugins and docs to jQuery 1.8.1.
- Added Contributing.md file.
- Added support for installing Bootstrap via [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower).
- Miscellaneous variable improvements across the board.
- Miscellaneous documentation typos fixed.
